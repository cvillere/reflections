What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		What happens when you initialize a repository is your
		files in whatever directory has been initialized as a 
		repository become tracked. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		The staging area is an intermediate area that doesn't reflect
		any changes on the repository, or directory. It offers value in that
		it allows for incremental changes to made instead of a ton of changes
		all at once. It gives flexibility where it is needed.
