When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
    work local in order to make collaboration easier and more fruitful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It allows you to determine what is seen on Github. You may
    have changed locally and want to keep it local. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of someone else's repository. A clone is a 
    copy of another repository, which is taken from GitHub and 
    brought down to a local machine. A branch is simply a 
    copy of repository, which differs in some way. Use would
    depend on the situation, but all 3 are useful in project
    development. A fork would be used when you want the repository 
    on your profile. If you want it kept on your local machine 
    until displaying it on github, use clone, then push a final 
    or finished product to github. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
